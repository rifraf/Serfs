Serfs
=====

Serfs is a "Simple Embedded Resource File System" for .Net.

Embedded resources are files that are built in to a .Net Assembly whose Build Action Property 
is set to 'Embedded Resource'. They can be placed in a directory-like structure.

Serfs provides a simple read-only access to such files in a way similar to reading files from
disk.

e.g. Stream stream = _serfs.OpenRead("files/test.txt")

You can tell Serfs which assemblies to get files from, and which set of files to select. When you
then try to access files, they appear to be merged into one collection, regardless of the
assembly they are in. 

If you want to separate files into different logical 'disks', just create separate instances.

Restrictions
------------
Although Serfs uses a traditional 'folder/filename' or 'folder\filename' path convention, embedded 
resources are actually stored with '.' separators. Also, spaces are stored as '_'. Serfs will try to
find the correct file, but it might be confused, say, by files "A file" and "A_file".

Contents

This repository contains 3 projects:

Serfs : The core Serfs dll.

TestSerfs : Tests for Serfs. Uses Gallio / MbUnit. Can be used as a reference for the API.

ResourcesForSerfsTest : A DLL containing no code, just embedded resources for TestSerfs.
